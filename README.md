# My Chatbot

This project aimed to create an innovative chatbot using OpenAI, designed to replicate the real-life interactions of a waiter in a pizza restaurant. The ultimate goal was to develop a seamless and engaging customer experience where the chatbot could effectively communicate with customers and efficiently take their orders. 

To achieve this, I delved into the realm of prompt engineering, experimenting with various strategies to optimize the chatbot's performance and make it capable of handling a wide range of customer requests and interactions.
